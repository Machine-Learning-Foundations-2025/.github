## Foundations of Machine Learning
Three weeks, 15 days, a lecture and exercises every day. The three-week course takes place from 9:00-17:00 at the University IT and Data Center (Hochschulrechenzentrum HRZ). The course structure is 90 minutes of lecture 90 min exercises, followed by 4 hrs of programming under guidance from the tutors.

Members of the University of Bonn can register via ecampus.

Prerequisites:
Programming in Python. If you are not yet familiar with python, please consult https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ before the first session.
